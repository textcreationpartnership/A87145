            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Grand De≈øigne, OR A di≈øcovery of that forme of ≈ølavery entended, and in part brought upon the free People of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN all Ages publique pretences have been made u≈øe of, for the advantaging and ≈øecuring of particular intere≈øts: Not to trace the foot-≈øteps of our Ance≈øtors, I ≈øhall come a little nearer, and bring to memory only the actings of a great party in our pre≈øent Parliament, and ≈øome, yea mo≈øt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in power in the Army, for the proving my A≈ø≈øertion.</p>
            <p>And now O ye free Commons of <hi>England,</hi> remember, at the beginning of this Parliament, what publique pretences were made u≈øe of to unite your affections in the management of their then de≈øigned undertakings? Was there any vi≈øible ≈øuffrage, or indeed ≈øuppo≈øed grievance, depending as a con≈øequent upon the King, and his Parties deportment, that was not laid down, and de-painted in the mo≈øt lively colours; to the end that the actors and contrivers might appeare odious; and the di≈øcoverers, and then oppo≈øers, famous; per≈øons de≈øerving both the love and a≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of that People, which they ≈øeemingly pretended to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from ≈øuch their then declared pre≈ø≈øures and grievances,</p>
            <p>At the beginning of this Parliament the whole Repre≈øentative declared again≈øt tho≈øe illegall practi≈øes of the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, touching <hi>Pattens, Monopolies, illegall Taxes,</hi> as <hi>Ship-money,</hi> and the like, to the end they might the better catch the affections of the People, that groaned under tho≈øe un≈øupportable burthens: But it may be remembred, that after tho≈øe Declarations had net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Royall party therein concerned; and that ≈øelf-intere≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to run a conte≈øt with publique concernments; how ≈øoon (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though before we had a full Parliament declaring) had we an

            <p>After many per≈øons had declined, and deviated from their fir≈øt principles (whereby a bloudy War was occa≈øioned) a ≈øecond party remaining in power, and plau≈øibly pretending the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ≈øafety (having by pretences of freedome beguiled the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a belief) took upon them (in≈øtead of executing ju≈øtice and judgement without partiality, and imploying the Law, in a way of ≈øafety and pre≈øervation) to oppre≈ø≈øe the oppre≈ø≈øed, and pervert ju≈øtice, to exerci≈øe power, more then rea≈øon, and to make Law ≈øubject to their own inordinate wills; ≈øtraining their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges beyond their due limmits, making them altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limmited: which being ob≈øerved and di≈øcovered by ≈øome great men in the Army (who pretended) as in the field) ≈øo in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) to endeavour the redemption of the Kingdome from ≈ølave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and oppre≈ø≈øion) a de≈øigne was carried on in the Army, and engagements pa≈ø≈øed thereupon, without, yea, again≈øt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnts liking; in as much as the Parliament had not (by rea≈øon of a malignant party prevalent therein) done tho≈øe things which they had formerly ≈øworn to performe, &amp; were in con≈øcience bound to do, in the di≈øcharge of their tru≈øt to them by the free Commons commited, and for as much as there was a de≈øign to engage the Kingdome in another war, &amp; en≈ølave the People of <hi>England</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Arbitrary power; carryed on by Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton,</hi> and others, as was ≈øuppo≈øed, and as indeed afterwards did manife≈øtly appear: The Army and Councell thereof did agree, and enter into an engagement, (again≈øt the Parliaments liking)
<pb facs="tcp:114990:3"/>
to endeavour and employ all their force to breake and prevent that de≈øign of rai≈øing another Army, and to defend, maintaine, and vindicate <hi>the liberties, and Native Birth-rights of all the free Commons of England,</hi> again≈øt all the endeavours, or oppo≈øition that could he made again≈øt it. In pur≈øuance whereof, it was by ≈øome per≈øons at L. Gen. <hi>Crumwels,</hi> he him≈øelfe being pre≈øent, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on monday at night before <hi>Whit≈øunday,</hi> 1647. re≈øolved, that for a≈ømuch as it was probable that the ≈øaid <hi>Hollis</hi> and his Party had a determination privately to remove the King to ≈øome place of ≈øtrength, or el≈øe to ≈øet him in the head of another Army; <hi>That therefore</hi> Cornet George Joyce, <hi>≈øhould with as much ≈øpeed and ≈øecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as might be, repaire to</hi> Oxford, <hi>to give in≈øtructions for the ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Garri≈øon, Magazine and Traine, therein, from the ≈øaid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then endeavouring to get the ≈øame, and then forthwith to gather ≈øuch a Party of Hor≈øe as he could conveniently get to his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, and either ≈øecure the per≈øon of the</hi> King <hi>from being removed by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or if occa≈øion were,</hi> to remove him to ≈øome place of better ≈øecurity, <hi>for the prevention of the de≈øign of the afore≈øaid pretended traiterous Party:</hi> Which was accordingly done, both with the knowledge and approbation of L. G. <hi>Crumwell,</hi> although he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward (like a <hi>≈øubtle Fox)</hi> would not be plea≈øed to take notice of it.</p>
            <p>This being done, and the two Polititians, <hi>Crumwell</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> finding them≈øelves compleatly ≈øeated in the affections of the ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, having caught them by their plau≈øible pretences of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Freedome. Indempnity, ≈øecurity,</hi> and the like; and being ≈øure likewi≈øe (by rea≈øon of their many Creatures in the Army, which they had advanced to places of promotion, and brought into the Councell) being ≈øure I ≈øay, to carry any thing that they ≈øhould propound, though they might meet with ≈øome oppo≈øers; they ca≈øt about fir≈øt how to un-hor≈øe that Faction that oppo≈øed them; which by a charge of Trea≈øon, and other mi≈ødemeanours <hi>(which they never yet had lei≈øure to prove, nor ever will)</hi> they in a ≈øhort time accompli≈øhed; which being done they made an e≈ø≈øay to do ≈øomething which ≈øeemed to tend to the e≈øtabli≈øhment of ju≈øtice, ≈øecuring the freedomes of the People, and ea≈øing of
<pb facs="tcp:114990:4"/>
the burthens of the Kingdome (that they might the better catch the affections of the People) which when they found to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed, and that the ≈øame party and their adherents were ≈øtill prevalent in the Hou≈øe,, and did vote again≈øt their proceedings, and by ≈øecret complotments did bring a tumult upon the Hou≈øe, forcing all members that were not of that party to ab≈øent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, e≈øpecially the Speakers, who with many other members came to the Army for ≈øecurity; which members ≈øitting and a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuming a parliamentary power during the <hi>Speakers</hi> ab≈øence, they declared to be illegall, and thereupon entred into a farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement at <hi>Houn≈ølo-heath,</hi> to march up to <hi>London,</hi> to purge the Hou≈øe of tho≈øe u≈øurpers of the Parliamentary Power, and to ≈øetle the free Parliament with honour and ≈øafety.</p>
            <p>In order whereunto the Army marched up to <hi>London,</hi> and being in a capacity to performe, what they had undertaken, and declared ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary, &amp; conducing to the peace of the Kingdom (by the ≈øubtill Sophi≈øtry of <hi>Crumwell</hi> and <hi>Ireton)</hi> the Generall was advi≈øed to leave it unto the Hou≈øe to purge it ≈øelfe, which was accordingly done, and what the effect hath been ≈øince; and how well the Hou≈øe hath been purged, I leave to all wi≈øe men to Judge; they all, or mo≈øt of them ≈øtill remaining therein, and they ≈øince owned and declared a true Parliament.</p>
            <p>But by the way you may take notice, that as a gratification the Hou≈øe made the Generall High Con≈øtable of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and I am ≈øure the L. Generall lo≈øt nothing by that, for he had an old ≈øervant or two to gratify, which he did ≈øuddenly after with pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both of profit and concernment; be≈øides, another Creature of his, Col. <hi>Hamond</hi> was pre≈øently advanced to be Governour of the <hi>I≈øle</hi> of <hi>Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, Having now got almo≈øt what they aimed at (to wit) The Per≈øon of the King; a con≈øiderable party in the Parliament; the Militia of the City; and the name of ≈øaving the Kingdome; they then begin to ca≈øt about how, to keep what they haye got, and that they find to be done but by two waies: the fir≈øt, by clo≈øing with the Parliament, in making ≈øuch <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitions</hi> as may plea≈øe the King, and thereby linke them≈øelves ≈øo

to the Kings intere≈øt and power, that they may be thereby ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the ju≈øt Taxes of the People which they have ≈øo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed and betrayed; or el≈øe by bringing the Army to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Parliament, that by their power, the Parliament might be ≈øtrengthened and enabled to hold both King and Kingdome to hard meate, and at la≈øt if the King would not a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to what they declare to be fit and requi≈øite, then to depo≈øe him, and take the power into their own hands, and if the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did not recent or reli≈øh the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, then by the power of the Army to quell and curb them: In order whereunto they ≈øent Propo≈øitions to the King, which being not a≈ø≈øented unto by him, it was put to the que≈øtion, whether they ≈øhould make any more addre≈ø≈øes; which argues that they had a good mind to throw off the King, if they could any way keep their power, and ≈øecure them≈øelves without him: But <hi>Ireton</hi> declares that he could not promi≈øe the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Army in any ≈øuch matter; <hi>his Father in lawes pul≈øes now beating a Lord-like pace,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a little before <hi>ki≈ø≈øed the Kings hand,</hi> and therefore ≈øince they are not likely to ≈øecure their power without him, they will by him; and to that end the Army mu≈øt be taught a new le≈ø≈øon, and whereas before, <hi>freedome, ≈øecurity, the purging of the Hou≈øe, a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od ≈øet to the Parliament,</hi> and the like, was the only theame; now only <hi>≈øecurity for Arreares, a little pay, &amp;c.</hi> mu≈øt be all that the Army de≈øires, and to what end think you, but that they might appear <hi>≈øeekers of them≈øelves,</hi> and ≈øo by degrees be lo≈øt in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the People; thus have they in a full careere po≈øted from the <hi>Saving,</hi> to the <hi>En≈ølaving</hi> the Kingdome: But by the way they met with a <hi>rub,</hi> for notwith≈øtanding that, they thought they had made all ≈øure, yet ≈øo it plea≈øed God to order and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe things, that their de≈øigne was made manife≈øt, and ≈øome men of upright hearts, were carried out in the ≈øeeking of ju≈øtice, and preventing the en≈ølaving of the Nation, and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, did ≈øeverall times, not only oppo≈øe all their <hi>en≈ølaving practices,</hi> but al≈øo offer unto them in open Councel, ≈øome <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of common freedome,</hi> ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to be in≈øi≈øted on, for the re-e≈øtating of the free Commoners of <hi>England</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:114990:5"/>
their <hi>antient birth-rights;</hi> which they, the ≈øaid <hi>De≈øigners,</hi> (to wit) <hi>Crumwell</hi> and <hi>Ireton;</hi> and the re≈øt of that <hi>rayalized Faction</hi> could by no meanes relli≈øh; neither would their high aimes ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to debate the ju≈øtne≈ø≈øe thereof; it being altogether cro≈ø≈øe to the Pias of their Ambition: But contrarily they rayled and reviled again≈øt tho≈øe, which either propounded or owned any ≈øuch matter, branding them with the name of dividers of the Army, factious per≈øons, and the like: And being fearefull that after all their labour they ≈øhould now be fru≈øtrated of their expectations, and by ≈øome under-hand dealing be deprived of the <hi>darling</hi> of their <hi>hopes,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> there mu≈øt be a pretended de≈øigne again≈øt the Kings per≈øon, di≈øcovered by L. G. <hi>Crumwell</hi> to his Cozen <hi>Whaley,</hi> and immediately after, (the Guards being fir≈øt doubled) there mu≈øt be a pretended e≈øcape of the King to avoid that pretended danger; but by the way remember, the King affirmes he had withdrawn his promi≈øe made to Col. <hi>Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> long before this pretended di≈øcovery, which was in order to his departure at that time determined without que≈øtion, and the other but a pretence made u≈øe of to colour the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>It may be remembred that the≈øe manner of pretences are no new things; for when the King fir≈øt di≈øcerted the Parliament, the pretence was Tumults, and the danger of his Per≈øon; and if you would know what tho≈øe tumults were, they were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the approaches of his oppre≈ø≈øed Subjects, with cryes for ju≈øtice, which he unju≈øtly denyed both his Parliament and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which becau≈øe he would not grant, he ab≈øented him≈øelfe, and made the danger of his Per≈øon by tho≈øe tumults as he called them, the ground of his departure; although it be notoriou≈øly apparent, that he was then privately providing to make warre with his Parliament and People, and in order thereunto, was ≈øending the jewels of the Crown to purcha≈øe Armes in <hi>Holland</hi> for the managing of the de≈øign afore≈øaid.</p>
            <p>Which acting and pretences then being compared with his pre≈øent acting in relation to his departure from <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and the now pretended cau≈øe thereof, will plainly appeare to be of the ≈øame ≈øtamp with the former; and in deed no other but a
<pb facs="tcp:114990:5"/>
de≈øign, not only to make odious, but al≈øo if advantage be offered, to cut off, and de≈øtroy all the godly per≈øons in the Kingdome, that ≈øhall but in the lea≈øt endeavour to oppo≈øe the exerci≈øe of his, and their Prerogative en≈ølaving tiranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call practi≈øes, in the ≈øecuring of the Peoples ju≈øt Rights and Freedomes.</p>
            <p>But if you ≈øhall con≈øider further, whether mu≈øt the King fly, or rather be carried, to avoid the pretended danger, but to <hi>Hammond</hi> at the <hi>I≈øle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> one of <hi>Crumwels</hi> own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there to remain, untill ≈øuch time as Propo≈øitions can be made ready ≈øutable to the Kings de≈øire, and an Act be pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed for the Parliaments indempnity; and <hi>then O you poore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed Commons, where will you obtain ju≈øtice or ≈øecurity, when your</hi> Tru≈øtees <hi>that pretended to deliver you, ≈øhall have thus</hi> to advance them≈øelves, <hi>betraied you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now if you ≈øhall de≈øire a rea≈øon why the≈øe men ≈øhould now at la≈øt derogate from their former pretended Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and ≈øhould not now, as heretofore, endeavour to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Peoples ju≈øt freedomes.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer; the Parliament, (or at lea≈øt a great part of them) are now brought to ≈øuch an exigency, that they cannot act otherwi≈øe with ≈øecurity to them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>It is ea≈øie to demon≈øtrate unto the world, that many of their actions have not, neither can they be warranted by Law, <hi>e≈øpecially their Arbitrary and illegall ≈øommoning, and committing per≈øons</hi> (contrary to Law) <hi>which all knowing men are re≈øolved for the future to prote≈øt again≈øt, and oppo≈øe, maugre the power of all that ≈øhall endeavour the execution or ju≈øtification of tho≈øe unju≈øt and tyrannicall practi≈øes:)</hi> And likewi≈øe, that by their continued, and redoubled oppre≈ø≈øions brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kingdome, they have not only lo≈øt the friend≈øhip of the People, but in a great mea≈øure purcha≈øed their enmity; ≈øo that now their condition is ≈øuch, that either they mu≈øt clo≈øe with the King, who≈øe intere≈øt in the People is now greater then theirs, having got what they have lo≈øt) that ≈øo,

what they cannot promi≈øe them≈øelves by their own power, they can a≈ø≈øure them≈øelves by his, (who without doubt hath ≈øo much policy as to promi≈øe both ≈øecurity &amp; advancement to a part, that he may the ea≈øilyer get into a capacity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølaving the whole.</p>
            <p>To be a little plainer; It cannot be immagined impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Parliament having lo≈øt the love of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, doubting the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Army, and wanting means (though without que≈øtion they have wills) to enable them to throw off the King, and by force to maintain their actions legall; I ≈øay, can it by any that have ≈øence or rea≈øon be imagined, that they will not to ≈øecure them≈øelves from the <hi>taxes of the People,</hi> the <hi>la≈øh of the Law,</hi> and <hi>Levelling,</hi> as they tearme it; that is, from being made (as all other Subjects) accountable to the Law, and People for all their actions) take any advantage or oportunity? And what better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can they have, then to joyn with the King? that by a≈ø≈øenting unto his de≈øires, they may engratiate them≈øelves into his favour, and wrapping them≈øelves up in his <hi>Mantle of tirannicall Royalty,</hi> and <hi>Protection,</hi> in their own honour &amp; ≈øecurity, leave all the free Commons of England, (by them animated, authorized, nay enforced to fight again≈øt, and ≈øubdue him) expo≈øed to the exa≈øperated rage of a <hi>conquered King,</hi> and incen≈øed Party, who will not faile, being once in power, to exalt them≈øelves in, and by the ruine of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øers; and like legitimate <hi>Imps</hi> of their <hi>Tyrant-exalter,</hi> Lord it over the <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you ≈øhall ask, wherein <hi>Crumwell, Ireton,</hi> and the re≈øt of that Faction, are concerned in the Parliaments acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I An≈øwer, they are Parliament men, and ≈øo bound up in the Parliaments actings; and indeed ≈øo involved in the Parliaments intere≈øt, (joyned to their own ends) that I can thinke it no other then a difficult matter, for them to deny them≈øelves in this Particular; Honour and profit being very potent allurements in the≈øe our ≈øelf-loving dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114990:6"/>
It is ob≈øervable that the≈øe two Polititians <hi>Crumwell,</hi> and <hi>Ireton,</hi> at fir≈øt were eager again≈øt all per≈øons that vi≈øibly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed them in the Parliament, but would never yeeld to the purging of the Hou≈øe,, only they would never be quiet till they had got out all tho≈øe that any way oppo≈øed them; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the late charge again≈øt the eleven Members, where (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Crumwel</hi> him≈øelfe confe≈ø≈øed at <hi>Colbrooke,</hi> that he had nothing again≈øt Sir <hi>John Mainard;</hi> yet he mu≈øt be put in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the re≈øt, and only becau≈øe he was a bu≈øie man again≈øt him and his faction: Having removed them he remaines ≈øatisfyed, untill he finds another party of <hi>Pellamites</hi> which endeavour to throw him out of the Sadle; and then he comes in with (I am per≈øwaded) a hearty ≈øorrow, confe≈ø≈øing, and praying God to forgive him, becau≈øe he had hindered the purging of the Hou≈øe: And why is the Lievtenant Generall ≈øo penitent thinke you? but only becau≈øe he feared they would be ≈øome hinderance to his high aimes.</p>
            <p>And here I ≈øhall in≈øert this Quere, <hi>Whether, con≈øidering that there are two Parties acting for particular intere≈øt, and each of them endeavouring to bring in the King, for the advancement of their own party,</hi> whether, I ≈øay, <hi>it be not probable that the King was removed by de≈øign, and enduced by engagement, to alter his former re≈øolution of not being removed; le≈øt the</hi> Pellamites <hi>≈øhould have ≈øerved</hi> Crumwell <hi>at</hi> Hampton, <hi>as he ≈øerved them at</hi> Holdenby? For my part if it were not ≈øo, it is to me a Ridle, which none I believe can unfold but hone≈øt <hi>Oliver,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, It may be demanded, ≈øeing that <hi>Crumwell</hi> is ≈øo active for his own parties intere≈øt, why the other party being as yet mo≈øt powerfull in the Hou≈øe have not outed him of his power?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, could they but bring the King in upon their own intere≈øt, and thereby ≈øecure them≈øelves in the attempt; I am confident they would tread him and his adherents low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: and that the Lievtenant General knowes well; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:114990:7"/>
               <hi>Hammond</hi> had never been Lord Chamberlaine; nor the King removed to the I≈øle of <hi>Wight;</hi> though I believe he never dreamt of the con≈øequences that have happened, and and are like to ≈øucceed therupon; that by the way; but to proceed, the King being gone, the City di≈øta≈øting them, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed over-awed, not daring by rea≈øon of their own divi≈øions, to appeare with, or for them; the Country wearied, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enclinable to endeavour the di≈ø≈øolution of their power, then any way to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them in the maintenance or ≈øupport thereof; and which is wor≈øt of all, the Army, (which ≈øhould by their power make their commands authentique) utterly rejecting their authority, and rendering them a trayterous Party, and per≈øons endeavouring the de≈øtruction of the ju≈øt rights and freedomes of the People; the≈øe things being duely con≈øidered, you may plainly ≈øee, that it is more for feare, then favour, that they clo≈øe with him, he being both politicke and powerfull, by rea≈øon of his adherents in the Hou≈øe, and creatures in the Army, in re≈øpect of which al≈øo they could not make u≈øe of a fitter in≈øtrument, to draw the Army to their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, if it might be; for the Father and the Sonne, with the re≈øt of their Family, from generation to generation, have the command of halfe the Army, all which having received their promotion and Principle from <hi>Crumwell,</hi> and looking ≈øtill to ri≈øe with him, will not move a foot beyond his in≈øtruction, nor as neare as they can, fall ≈øhort of it; and as the King is his Idoll, ≈øo he is theirs, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether in the executing what their own honour and intere≈øt dictates unto them.</p>
            <p>It is a commendable thing in the Lievetenant Generall to advance his kindred, and ≈øervants, ≈øo it be done by good wayes, and for ju≈øt ends; not to advance lawle≈ø≈øe ambition, &amp; ≈øtrengthen irregular attempts, if ≈øo; he may chance in the mid≈øt of his Golden hopes meet with <hi>Buckinghams</hi> Fate, or <hi>Straffords</hi> doome, and in ≈øtead of honour inherit infamy.</p>
